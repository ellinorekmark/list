# List

## Introduction
This is a small hobby project, currently a Work in Progress, that I occasionally spend time on. The concept is simple, users can create lists and share them with other users. 
It's a Spring Boot application with a MySql database. Users have the option to create different type of lists, and to invite other users into their lists. 
It started with me needing something to write about for my final assignment at school, and ended up being a fun hobby project for personal use.
